To-Do List:

1. Add feature asking user to specify body weight (lbs.)
2. Add feature asking user to specify BMI in order to calculate body fat percentage
3. Add feature asking user to whether work-out ended due to unnatural causes (injury, a stranger, etc.)
4. Add feature where user can input notes on each exercise.
5. Add feature where if user specifies "False" for Sets completed, an expanded exercise question change is engaged.
   This time asking for how many reps for each set, enumerating the sets as specified by the user. This will account
   for situations where the user has drop sets and stuff.
6. Automatically detect user's time zone from their OS, so sick of being asked now.
7. Ask user to provide overall notes for the fitness session.

Things fixed in this commit:
1. Weightage and Reps values are input as integers instead of strings
2. Weight and Reps are assigned as singular values instead of list entries if consistent
3. Average_Time_Per_Workout variable readjusted to format HH:MM:SS instead of H:MM:SS
4. Same thing done for Average_Time_Between_Sets
5. Cause of Failure variable now listed as strings instead of integer values
6. Created Timed Exercise concept to account for different exercise data structure for exercises like Farmer's Carry
7. Redesigned weight_type as weight_setup and doing something different with weight_type

- Machine Used: False
- Weightage: Bodyweight
- Weight Type: N/A
- Start Time: 6:50 PM
- End Time: 7:00 PM
- Notes: Could only do 1 round fully. The itching on my skin completely
         killed all momentum and will to box. After doing some research,
         some folks shared that they experience the same itching at the
         beginning of every workout - stating it goes away after you're
         warmed up. I have to say, that is exactly what happened yesterday.
         I was itching for the first two exercises, then I was chillin'
         after. Think this means I need to do my upper body as warm up
         before the boxing. We'll try it.

1. Exercise 1
- Name: Cable Raises
- Machine Used: True
- Machine Name: Adjustable Cable
- Weightage: 5 lbs.
- Start Time: 6:12 PM
- End Time: 6:20 PM
- Notes: 6 sets of 30 reps, 3 sets for each hand. I could only managed 4 sets of 30, with the last 2 sets being only
         25 reps. Time extended due to encounter with gym-goer claiming the 
         machine I walked up to. Told them to use the other, open machine if
         they want to bounce between two machines between sets.

2. Exercise 2
- Name: Boxing
- Machine Used: False
- Weightage: Bodyweight
- Weight Type: N/A
- Start Time 1: 6:31 PM
- End Time 1: 6:45 PM
- Notes: Could only do 5 2-minute (1-min rests) rounds fully. The exhaustion was better today. Took my trainer's advice and put them
         force into all my movements. Went loosey goosey. Still felt good after
         round 5, only reason I stopped was because I have food bank duty for my
         company tomorrow.

3. Exercise 3
- Name: Single Lat Pull-Downs
- Machine Used: True
- Weightage: 40 lbs.
- Start Time: 6:55 PM

1. Exercise 1
- Name: Cable Raises
- Machine Used: True
- Machine Name: Adjustable Cable
- Weightage: 5 lbs.
- Start Time: 6:37 PM
- End Time: 6:48 PM
- Notes: 6 sets of 30 reps, 3 sets for each hand.

2. Exercise 2
- Name: Single Lat Pull-Downs
- Machine Used: True
- Weightage: 40 lbs.
- Start Time: 6:48 PM
- End Time: 6:54 PM
- Notes: I Did 3 sets of 30 reps. I mis-remembered the number of reps I usually do with this exercise. I thought I was bumping it up from 20 reps to
         30 reps. 30 lbs. at 30 reps was too easy, so for the last two sets - I moved it up to 40 lbs.

3. Exercise 3
- Name: Boxing
- Machine Used: False
- Weightage: Bodyweight
- Weight Type: N/A
- Start Time: 6:56 PM
- End Time: 7:21 PM
- Notes: I was able to complete 9 two-minute rounds. I can't say that they were done fully. Of each round, I maybe dropped about 20-25 seconds of each
         round in order to maintain my stamina. I wasn't going all out - that has proven to be too expensive and kills the workout. Had to drop the last
         round due to discomfort and strain on my joints / tendons in my knees.

4. Exercise 4
- Machine Used: False
- Weightage: Bodyweight
- Weight Type: N/A
- Start Time: 7:27 PM
- End Time: 7:28 PM
- Notes: Yup. Definitely sustained some minor injury. I jump two times before my knee very kindly suggested I stop doing that. Called it quits pretty
         quickly. There in lied the end of my fitness session.
